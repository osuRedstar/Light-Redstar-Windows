### Tillerino-like commands
Aika has some commands similar to Tillerino. Those commands work only if you send them to Aika through a PM. Remember that PP system has been implemented only on osu!standard and osu!mania. The bot doesn't support beatmaps recommendations at the moment, that functionality wil come later, hopefully.

- `/np` - Show PP for the current playing song  (only if is a osu! standard song)  
- `!last` - Show info (and gained PP, if it was an osu! standard score) about the last submitted score  
- `!with <mods>` - Show PP for the previous requested beatmap with requested mods. Supported mods are `NF, EZ, HD, HR, DT, HT, NC, FL, SO, RX, AP.`. Don't use spaces for multiple mods (eg: `!with HDHR`)
