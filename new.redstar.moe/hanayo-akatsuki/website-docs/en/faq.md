- **I didn't receive the verification email, I cannot verify my account!**
- There is no verification email. In order to activate the account, you simply have to log in through the game. You can read all the required steps on our [connection guide](/doc/connection_guide).

-----------------------

- **I get "Connection failed" when I try to connect to Akatsuki**  
- Make sure you've followed all steps correctly from our [connection guide](https://akatsuki.pw/doc/connection_guide). If you still can't solve this problem, come on our [Discord](https://akatsuki.pw/discord) and we'll help you.

-----------------------

- **I get "Bancho authentication failed" (wrong password) when I try to log in, but my password is correct!**  
- First, make sure you're connected to Akatsuki and that your password is corrected. If so, type your Akatsuki username and password, then press the **login** button with your mouse. I know, it's weird but it often works. *(make also sure that caps lock is disabled if your password is lowercase)*

-----------------------

- **I can't download maps from osu!direct.**
- Unranked beatmaps can't be downloaded from our beatmap mirror due to technical reasons.

-----------------------

- **I can't download maps when I'm in multiplayer, but I can download them from the main menu**
- Disable **Automatically start osu!direct downloads** from the options and try again. Alternatively, you can use the `!b`/`!bloodcat` command in `#multiplayer` and `#spectator` to get a download link for the current beatmap.

-----------------------

- **How do I play on the normal osu! again?**
- Visit our [connection guide](/doc/connection_guide) to learn how to return to Bancho.

-----------------------

- **Can I keep playing while the server is restarting because it's updating?**
- Yes, your scores will be sent as soon as the server gets back online (usually less than a minute). Just make sure to not close the client.

-----------------------

- **Is there a way to display misses on Relax?**
- Yes! You can enable misses to display on Relax using our [patcher](https://akatsuki.pw/patcher).

-----------------------

- **Why is my computer flagging the Akatsuki Patcher as a potential threat?**
- The Patcher is a program which injects itself to your game client and makes modifications to it, which isn't something your computer considers to be friendly. But don't worry! Our patcher doesn't byte. Just disable your antivirus and try redownloading or running it again, should work perfectly.

-----------------------

- **Can I have Akatsuki's source code?**
-  Akatsuki is mostly open source, you can see it [here](https://github.com/osuAkatsuki/).

-----------------------

- **Why are osu!direct and other in-game supporter perks free?**
- We think that osu! direct is very cool and it's a shame people have to pay to have it, that's why we're offering it for free on Akatsuki. If you like what we do, please consider a [donation](/donate)!
