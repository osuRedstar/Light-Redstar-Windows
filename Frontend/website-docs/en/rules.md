<h4 class="cenetered">Rules may be changed at any time as we see fit.<br>New rules may or may not be retroactive at our own discretion.</h4>

<h3><i class="game icon"></i> General rules</h3>

#### _Any violation of the rules in this section will result in a **restriction or ban, temporary or permanent**, depending on the gravity._

1. **Cheating** and any other form of hacking are strictly prohibited.
2. **Edited clients,** with the exception for the next rule, are not allowed.
3. **Client patching** (instead of host redirection) is allowed but we won't help you if you break the client.
4. **Shared or boosted** accounts are not allowed.
5. Don't try to **exploit the server** or other akerino. If you intend to report a vulnerability, do so responsibly and by contacting the developers.
6. Use an **appropriate username** (no offensive or **stolen names**, e.g. you can't choose to be Cookiezi, WubWoofWolf, Rafis, _index, etc...)
7. **Don't abuse our patience;** while we try to best satisfy our users' need, if you repeatedly infringe our rules or abuse services provided by the staff (e.g. appealing and name changing) (with particular regard to users who also disrespect our staff's efforts, passively or actively, or are otherwise toxic within the community), we will first warn you, and if it comes to it we will offer an ultimatum. If you refuse or otherwise don't change your behaviour, we'll have no choice but to ban you.

<h3><i class="comment icon"></i> Chat rules</h3>

#### _Any violation of the rules in this section will result in a **silence**._

These apply to both Discord AND the in-game chat. The Discord chat also has some rules which are specific to the Discord server itself; for this reason you should also check out the `#rules` channel on the server.

1. Avoid any kind of insults to people. Try to be friendly. If not, try to discuss in a constructive manner.
2. Racial slurs are absolutely not allowed. Terms like "retarded", and "autistic" are fine on objects, definitely not on people.
3. Don't **spam or flood**, unless you're occasionally sending a link to e.g. Twitch when you're streaming Redstar when no discussion is going on.
4. Any kind of **illegal content, warez, or viruses** is strictly prohibited. (This includes posting parts of source code that you have no legal right to share.)
5. No NSFW or gore content.
6. Unless it's a language channel, please speak English.
7. Don't make any kind of **cheating accusation** (Use #cheaterreporting on Discord or report the person you suspect to a Community Manager)
8. Remember also to follow the **General rules** above!

<h3><i class="user icon"></i> Profile rules</h3>

#### _Any violation of the rules in this section will result in a **silence and userpage/avatar reset**._

1. **NSFW and offensive** avatars/userpage contents are not allowed.
2. Don't link to **illegal stuff**/porn/warez/viruses on userpages.
3. Do not use **offensive custom badges** and do not **pretend to be someone else with your custom badge**. If you abuse the badges system, you'll be silenced and you won't be able to edit your custom badge anymore.

<h3><i class="file text outline icon"></i> Cheat/multiaccount policy</h3>

#### _This is how we handle cheaters and multiaccounters on Redstar._

1. Cheating and multiaccount is strictly prohibited.
2. It doesn't matter if you cheated on any other osu! server - we only care about what you did on Redstar.
3. Multiaccounts are **NOT** allowed, with the **SOLE EXCEPTION OF CHAT BOTS**.  If you are developing one and need an account for it,  mail [support](mailto:support@redstar.moe) (or a [dev](mailto:aniren@debian.moe))
4. We reserve the right to change these rules as we see fit.

<h3><i class="list layout icon"></i> Miscellaneous</h3>

1. You can change your profile flag mailing [support](mailto:support@redstar.moe), and sending a picture with a valid document and a post-it or a piece of paper with your Redstar name.
2. Name changes are handled through our [support website.](https://support.redstar.moe)
