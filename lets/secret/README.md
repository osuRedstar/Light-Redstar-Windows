oh, so that's the secret.

# Please note the following
- This is not what ripple uses

# Rundown of what this is for those who does not get the joke
This is an automated anticheat (more or less).

For those who knows a little bit about how osu works you should already know that osu sends the process list and other stuff to the server.

This is not something unique about ripple, this is just how the game is made and we could chose to use it how official uses it or ignore it and will have to manualy go thru and check users. You will most likely never be checked unless you get marked by the automated process check.

So this boils down to; do we check your process to find interesting things like websites you got open etc.

The answer to that is no. We can not care less for what anime you watch and has no interests in going thru massive amount of data for no reason (surprisingly we do not want to go out of our way to catch hackers, but if we dont have a system for it then you know what will happen).

## NOTE:
Feel free to use this, You can ask how stuff works if unsure but not related to setting this up.
