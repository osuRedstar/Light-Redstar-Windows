- osu!standard and taiko pp calculation with [oppai-ng](https://github.com/francesco149/oppai-ng), made by Franc[e]sco
- osu!standard relax pp calculation with [ainu-rx-calc](https://github.com/osuthailand/ainu-rx-calc), made by Franc[e]sco and edited by Hazuki-san
- osu!mania pp calculation with `wifipiano2`, made by Nyo with reference code from [Tom94's osu-performance](https://github.com/ppy/osu-performance)
- catch the beat pp calculation with [catch-the-pp](https://github.com/osuripple/catch-the-pp), made by Sunpy and cythonized by Nyo


## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- Cython
- C compiler

## How to set up LETS
First of all, initialize and update the submodules
```
$ git submodule init && git submodule update
$ cd secret && git submodule init && git submodule update && cd ..
```
afterwards, install the required dependencies with pip
```
$ python3.6 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
compile all `*.pyx` files to `*.so` or `*.dll` files using `setup.py` (distutils file).
This compiles `catch-the-pp` as well.
```
$ python3.6 setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
then, run LETS once to create the default config file and edit it
```
$ python3.6 lets.py
$ nano config.ini
```
finally, compile `oppai-ng` (inside pp/oppai-ng) and `ainu-rx-calc` (inside pp/oppai-rx) to make pp calculation working
```
$ cd ./pp/oppai-ng/ && chmod +x ./build && ./build && cd ./../../
$ cd ./pp/oppai-rx/ && chmod +x ./build && ./build && cd ./../../
```

Did you know?: You can configure more stuff in common/config.json after you run LETS! Like ppboard or making Relax ranked!

## tomejerry.py
`tomejerry.py` is a tool that allows you to calculate pp for specific scores. It's extremely useful to do mass PP recalculations if you mess something up. It uses lets' config and packages, so make sure lets is installed and configured correctly before using it.
```
usage: tomejerry.py [-h]
                    [-r | -z | -i ID | -m MODS | -g GAMEMODE | -u USERID | -b BEATMAPID | -fhd]
                    [-w WORKERS] [-cs CHUNKSIZE] [-v]

pp recalc tool for ripple, new version.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r, --recalc          calculates pp for all high scores
  -z, --zero            calculates pp for 0 pp high scores
  -i ID, --id ID        calculates pp for the score with this score_id
  -m MODS, --mods MODS  calculates pp for high scores with these mods (flags)
  -g GAMEMODE, --gamemode GAMEMODE
                        calculates pp for scores played on this game mode

  -b BEATMAPID, --beatmapid BEATMAPID
                        calculates pp for high scores played on a specific
                        beatmap (beatmap_id)
  -fhd, --fixstdhd      calculates pp for std hd high scores (14/05/2018 pp
                        algorithm changes)
  -w WORKERS, --workers WORKERS
                        number of workers. 16 by default. Max 32
